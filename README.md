## Development and testing

Replace *muscop* package of this repo in ardusim official *muscop* package (if the official repo doesn't contains the extension):

## Abstract

MUSCOP is a drone control protocol based on Slaves UAVs that follows a Master UAV (Center) in the course of an air mission. The current problem with this protocol is that if the master drone fails, the other drones do not finish the mission. Our proposal consists of an extension of this protocol to tolerate failures in the master drone, in order to permit the remaining drones to complete the mission.
